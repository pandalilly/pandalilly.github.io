              You know how a quarter-life crisis hits you? No? Let me explain
              then.
            </p>

            <p>
              A quarter-life crisis occurs at the age of 25 for a female with
              depression, anxiety and chronic imposter syndrome. Generally, said
              subject is highly qualified and intelligent, but with severe
              mental health issues that are exacerbated by a climate change
              crisis, an unstable global economy and black tax. Nothing out of
              the ordinary, really.
            </p>
            <p>
              All right, now that we are well acquainted, let me get to the
              point of Pandalilly. It is as a consequence of this period that I
              decided I wanted to live life on my own terms. Admittedly, this
              period is still in progress. Daily, I remind myself that I have
              decided to do things how I see fit and daily, I fight the urge to
              give up. That is why Pandalilly exists. What is most motivating,
              is sitting in front of a computer, programming, and generally
              mucking around the internet. That is part of living life on my own
              terms. As such, Pandalilly is a collection of projects that I will
              undertake to make myself feel happy and satisfied.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am hoping that daily, I see a purpose in pursuing ideas,
              concepts and projects for the fun of it. At the moment, I am
              working on honing my software development skills. For now, these
              are the kinds of projects that will form the initial collection
              for Pandalilly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Actually, now that memory serves me well, the first Pandalilly
              project started when I bought a Raspberry Pi in order to apply for
              jobs. I was unemployed for a moment in 2020 (about 5 weeks) and
              had given in my work laptop, had given away my laptop to a family
              member who was now studying at university, and left only with my
              smartphone. Not ideal for applying for jobs. So naturally, I
              looked into low-cost solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Back at university, I had been introduced to the concept of
              single-board computers, and that Arduino and Raspberry Pis were
              such examples, with benefits of being cost-effective. After, some
              research I bought a kit for R1300 (incl. delivery). And that kit,
              for the next two months, served as my desktop computer. On my Pi,
              I applied for jobs, watched YouTube videos and even learnt the
              basics of programming in Python.
            </p>
            <p>
              This sparked a joy I could not fathom. I realized that I loved
              learning, but most importantly, I LOVE programming. It combines
              creativity and systematic logic, layered on computer science
              principles. (And it’s about system design. System. That word
              alone, brings me peace). The joy of executing a little script and
              it works, is unmatched in my opinion.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had flashbacks to my high school years, sitting in front of a
              CRT screen and coding IT projects in Delphi (programming
              language). Although I was not allowed internet access, I found
              ways to entertain myself on my computer. I partitioned my hard
              drive, defragged it (it’s a Windows thing), installed all kinds of
              things and mucked around the Windows filesystem, often to my
              demise. There were one or two times where I accidentally deleted
              everything, but that was fine. I just had to start a couple of
              school projects from scratch. The same thing did not happen with
              my Pi… except that one time…
            </p>
            <p>
              My Pi made me realize that I love computers, learning about how
              they work and how to talk to them. This is most fascinating to me.
              And so, I decided to channel all this energy into a personal
              project. I’m currently learning JavaScript, functional programming
              techniques and Haskell. Oh, and Linux system admin things. It’s a
              lot but I’m getting closer and closer everyday to building
              something I can integrate into my life for fun. But I have to
              start here first.
            </p>
            <p>
              Come along and see what else Pandalilly is going to be about.
              Because, I love writing, poetry and photography. Get ready for
              some mediocre but highly joyful art (for me). And perhaps, even
              more mediocre code. Mediocrity is as mediocrity does. But you
              gotta try… just in case;
